# Generating the Final Report

Generate the report by simply running the command make in the terminal.
The report is about a study on the effect of a dance intervention on PD
patients, and contains a table describing the demographics of the
patients, a table with their scores on psychosocial questionnaires, a
table detailing linear models built to predict their psychosocial
questionnaire scores, and a plot visualizing their responses to exit
questionnaires.

## File Organization

The code for creating the tables and figures is located in the Code
directory. Table 1 is generated by Code/01_make_table_one.R, Table 2.1
is generated by Code/02_make_table_two.R, Table 2.2 is generated by
Code/03_make_table_three.R, and the figure is generated by
Code/04_exit_qs.R. Raw data is stored in the Data directory, cleaned
data is stored in the CleanData directory, and tables/figures are stored
in the Outputs directory.
