# Generating the Final Report

Generate the report by simply running the command make in the terminal. The report is about a study on the effect of a dance intervention on PD patients, and contains a table describing the demographics of the patients, a table with their scores on psychosocial questionnaires, a table detailing linear models built to predict their psychosocial questionnaire scores, and a plot visualizing their responses to exit questionnaires.

## File Organization

The code for creating the tables and figures is located in the Code directory. Raw data is stored in the Data directory, cleaned data is stored in the CleanData directory, and tables/figures are stored in the Outputs directory.
